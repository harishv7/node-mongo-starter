# node-mongo-starter

This is a simple starter project which provides an API structure and MongoDB connection out-of-the-box.

## Create .env
To start, create a `.env` file in the root of the project with a key `DB_URL` which is the URI to connect to the MongoDB database. You can either choose this to be a locally running instance of MongoDB or use a connection string from a cluster you created in [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/).

## Running the app
Use `npm i` to install the required dependencies.
Use `node index.js` to start the app.
